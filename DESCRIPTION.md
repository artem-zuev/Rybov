### **Rybov Token Description**

We are beginning the development of a token called **Rybov**, a digital currency designed for everyday use between spouses, friends, family members, and other close relationships. Rybov is created to simplify the system of small rewards for completing household and everyday tasks, such as:

- "Make tea",
- "Clean the bathroom",
- "Pick up groceries early", etc.

#### **Core Concept**
The goal of the Rybov token is to provide a reward-based system that not only adds motivation but also helps strengthen social and family bonds. Participants will be able to:
- Create, assign, and complete various tasks.
- Automatically earn rewards for completed tasks (in the form of Rybov tokens).
- Manage internal relationships within the platform — for example, adding friends or establishing a spouse status.

The token will operate through a smart contract deployed on the **Polygon blockchain**, which ensures low transaction costs and fast confirmation times.

### **Tokenomics**
- **Token Standard**: ERC20.
- **Primary Use Case**: Interaction in family and friend circles with rewards for activities.
- **Minting Model**: Tokens are minted automatically as tasks are completed. This makes the core of emission a **merit-based reward system**.
- **Network**: Polygon (initial deployment in the Polygon Mumbai testnet before the mainnet launch). The decision to use Polygon is based on:
   - Minimal transaction fees;
   - High transaction confirmation speed;
   - Full compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.

---

### **Benefits**
1. **Transparency**: All operations related to task creation, assignment, completion, and validation are recorded on the blockchain.
2. **Low Transaction Costs**: The Rybov token runs on Polygon, making it affordable for daily use.
3. **Flexibility and Scalability**:
   - The token supports upgradeability using the **UUPS pattern** provided by OpenZeppelin, enabling future enhancements without replacing the current contracts.
4. **Motivation**: The system encourages completing tasks while adding a gamified element to everyday life.
5. **Strengthening Social Connections**: Interactions between participants are built on trust and support, and the token adds an element of mutual appreciation.

### **Key Features**
1. **Task Management**:
   - Create tasks with specified rewards in Rybov tokens.
   - Assign tasks to another user (based on established relationships in the system).
   - Automatically transfer task rewards upon completion and validation.
2. **Relationship Management**:
   - Users can add each other as friends, spouses, or other types of connections to use the system collaboratively.
   - Relationships can also be removed to avoid unwanted interactions.
3. **Blockchain-Centric**:
   - Task and balance management is handled directly through the smart contract, accessible only to wallet owners.

---

### **Example Use Case**
1. A spouse creates a task: "Make tea" with a reward of 5 tokens.
2. The other party accepts the task, completes it, and marks it as done.
3. Once the task is verified, the reward of 5 tokens is automatically credited to the balance of the performer.

### **Token Roadmap**
1. **Phase 1**: (Launch of basic smart contract)
   - Implementation of the basic ERC20 token functionality.
   - Introducing task management and creating a simple system of user relationships.
   - Deployment to Polygon Mumbai testnet.
2. **Phase 2**: (Pilot launch)
   - Testing the system with real users.
   - Collecting user feedback.
3. **Phase 3**: (Production launch)
   - Deployment of the main contract on the Polygon Mainnet.
   - Integration with mobile/web applications for easier interaction.

---

### **Planned Features**
- Integration with popular messaging apps and social platforms for easier interactions with smart contracts.
- Development of a simplified interface via a mobile application.
- Expanding functionality—for example, adding the ability to create group tasks and reward multiple participants.

---

### **Future Goals**
- Enhancing user experience through intuitive interfaces.
- Exploring partnerships to integrate Rybov into larger ecosystems of daily interactions.
- Scaling the project to accommodate not only families and friends but also small teams and communities.

---

### **Why Polygon?**
- **Low Costs:** Affordable for day-to-day microtransactions.
- **Speed:** Operations are processed and settled near-instantly.
- **Ethereum Compatibility:** Seamless integration into Web3 tools and services.

---

### **Conclusion**
Rybov is not just a convenient tool for motivating loved ones but also an innovative Web3-driven social and family ecosystem. Leveraging the Polygon network ensures high efficiency, minimal operating costs, and ease of use for everyday users.
